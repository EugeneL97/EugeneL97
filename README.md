I've been diving deep into **backend and systems engineering**, building **performance-driven applications** across different domains. My recent work includes:

- **Backend Development (Go/Python):**  
  Migrated backend services for event planning from **Flask to Go**, improving **concurrency and scalability**.  
  - Handled **1,000+ requests/sec**, reducing response time to **50ms** and cutting memory usage by **40%** compared to Flask.

- **Systems & Performance (C++):**  
  Achieved **faster memory allocation** than `std::vector` using a **pre-allocated buffer**, improving efficiency in **fixed-size scenarios**.

- **Algorithm Visualization (SFML):**  
  Ported initially from **Pygame**. Improved performance ranging from **20 to 120 FPS**, depending on the algorithm.  
  - Reduced **CPU usage by 40%** during high-iteration simulations.

I'm especially passionate about **optimizing backend architectures, scaling distributed systems, and improving algorithm efficiency**. I enjoy tackling **high-performance computing challenges** and building **resilient software solutions**.

I'm currently looking for a **backend or full-stack engineering role**, where I can apply my expertise in **C++, Python, Go, and web technologies** to solve **scalability and performance challenges**.
